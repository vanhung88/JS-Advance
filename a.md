there is a hidden password that you are not aware of. write a function to recover the original password from a collection of random triplets from the password. a triplet is defined as three-letter sequence in which each letter appears someplace before the next in the provided string. "scr" is a triplet for the password "secret".
We have no letter appears more than once in the password. the password will never contain letters that do not appear in one of the triplets you were given and the triplets with enough information fo determine the origin of the string.

input triplets = [
['t','u','p'],
['w','h','i'],
['t','s','u'],
['a','t','s'],
['h','a','p'],
['t','i','s'],
['w','h','s'],
]

output = "whatisup"
